# Busy Person Tool : A Third-Party API Challenge

## Description

The challenge is to use starter code HTML, CSS, Javascript, to create an unsophisticated calendar app for a 'busy' user. The intention is to allow the user to save events for each hour of the day, as needed, whereby their events saved would persist after refreshing the page.

Through implementing jQuery dynamic modifcation of HTML and CSS, the hour-blocks in the calendar are also color-coded based on the time of day to show whether the hour has passed, is now, or is in the future. This also entails the use of the Day.js API to have the app check the current time against the one stated in either hour-block.

The biggest take-aways from finishing this project were: practicing DOM traversal using jQuery/Javascript, getting accustomed to using the Day.js API, some practice with using bootstrap components, honing HTML and CSS developing, and, last but not least, getting more practice with browswer DevTools (e.g., console, application).

Great challenge!
